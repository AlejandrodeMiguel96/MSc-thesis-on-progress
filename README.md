# MSc-thesis-on-progress

This repository contains the necessary files to run the programme. 
However, the database files are missing because they are bigger than allowed.
The files are: 
"database_single_leg_635927.npz"
"dense_database.npz"

For the neural network, only the following files should be needed:
"Neural Network.py" contains the neural network structure, training, evaluation and plots.
"NN_data.py" contains the relevant data defining the neural network.

For the generation of the inspection leg database, the main files are:
"SBMPO_single_leg.py" which contains the steps to compute a single inspection leg (instead of a full inspection of multiple legs).
"database_singleleg_generation.py" which contains the steps to run the "SBMPO_single_leg.py" multiple times and store the results, and create a database.

For any doubts or additional info you can contact me at: alejandro.demiguel@mail.polimi.it

Thanks! :)
